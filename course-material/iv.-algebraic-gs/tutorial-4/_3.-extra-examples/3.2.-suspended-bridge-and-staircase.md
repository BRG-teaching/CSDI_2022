# 3.2. Suspended Bridge and Staircase

Two other examples are studied in this page to show additionall functionalities of IGS. A Suspended Bridge and a Staircase

## 1. Suspended Bridge

The asymmetrical suspended bridge below was calculated with IGS. It is composed of 29 edges. It requires 7 independent edges, that we select as the loads applied to the deck to the right of the pylon. The height of the pylon is 5.0m above and beyond the deck.

We could be interested in reducing the magnitude of the forces in the deck, this can be achieved with a higher pylon. Moving the top of the pylon is a good idea, a sin the picture below:

The final form and force diagram are depicted below:

The suspended bridge is a great example to test also the unified diagram. This diagram contains at the same time the form and the force diagram and can be modified through the parameter alpha which scales it to meet the form or the force diagram. The Force diagram can be rotated of 90 degrees to enhance the visualisation. The results are depicted below:

## 2. Staircase

The stair below is composed of 33 curves. It requires 5 independent edges, that are selected as forces applied to the top girder of the stair (assigned with negative sign). The form and force diagram obtained with IGS are shown below:

We could envisage a slope change of the structure, to be executed in the force diagram. We first fix the four central portions of the structure to serve as a reference. Then we define the new slope and calculate the deflection that any couple of nodes in the force diagram has to overcome. The scheme with the magnitude of these displacements is shown in the next figure:

After this modification, the equilibrium is recomputed and the shape of the stair with the new slope is found:

With the current solver this notification yields in an angle deviation of 0.23 deg. Such maximum deviation can be modified in the solver settings.
