# 3. Extra Examples

A few additional examples are available to show more functions of IGS. The input lines for these examples is sent together with the [Rhino template](../1.-analysis-with-ags/) file.

First, we study the problem of concentrated load on an arch:

{% content-ref url="additional-examples.md" %}
[additional-examples.md](additional-examples.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The second discusses a suspended bridge and a staircase example:

{% content-ref url="3.2.-suspended-bridge-and-staircase.md" %}
[3.2.-suspended-bridge-and-staircase.md](3.2.-suspended-bridge-and-staircase.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

And an advanced tutorial to design Maillart's Chiasso Shed truss is also provided:

{% content-ref url="4.-extra-examples.md" %}
[4.-extra-examples.md](4.-extra-examples.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You made it! Now you know everything about computational 2D graphic statics! :tada:
