## Tasks

Complete the following five tasks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the Rhinoceros file named CSDI_V_exercise.3dm. Then, answer the questions in the docx file. You will find all these files **here**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 1. Modifying the force diagram

In the first task, you will design a shell with a rectangular footprint which is a cross vault (see Fig-XX for inspiration). Use one of the input methods we learned in the tutorial to input a topology which measures 15 m by 15 m overall and is subdivided into X by X (a total of X quadrilaterals). Follow the steps from the tutorial to make your cross vault. Save your RV3 session in this format : `V_1_a_jane-smith.ui`.

Now, `Clear scene` and re-using your topology, this time delete the central vertex by following the steps in the tutorial for modifying a pattern. Finish the formfinding process, then save your RV3 session in this format : `V_1_b_jane-smith.ui`.


### 2. Holes

Create a shell with an 8m by 8m footprint which is subdivded into X by X quadrilaterals. Using the same steps as in part b of the task 1, remove the central vertex of your pattern and complete your formfinding. Look closely at your results and answer the questions in the `.docx` file for this task. 

Next, using the same steps for modifying the pattern, create a hole which is near one of the corner supports. Answer the questions in the `.docx` file. 

Now, for comparison, we are going to create the shell with a hole in the center using the **triangulation** input method. Draw the linework and give it to RV3. Again, answer the questions in the `.docx` file.

### 3. Lip edges

For this task recreate one of the roof modules from the Heinz Isler Tennis Hall using RV3.
