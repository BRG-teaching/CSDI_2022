# 0. Intro to TNA and RV2

### Thrust Network Analysis and RhinoVAULT2

So far, the previous modules of our course showed methods, based on Graphic Statics, for the form-finding of 2D structures. You have learned how to construct form and force diagrams in a procedural and algebraic way and how to interact with them.&#x20;

Can we now extend this powerful tool to 3D structures, keeping control of the form and forces? &#x20;

One method based on Graphic Statics that allows designers to form-find funicular 3D structures is the Thrust Network Analysis (TNA). In TNA, you will find most of the concepts seen in the previous modules, which you are already familiar with (form and force diagrams, supports, loads, and equilibrium).&#x20;

The TNA method is the theoretical framework on which RhinoVAULT was built. In this module, you will learn how to use RhinoVAULT2 (RV2), a Rhino plugin that replaces RhinoVAULT for Rhino versions 6 and above. RV2 is an open-source research and development platform for funicular form-finding built with [COMPAS](https://compas-dev.github.io/), a Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in Architecture, Engineering, and Digital Fabrication. &#x20;

#### TNA workflow

The relationship between the compression equilibrium shape, the thrust network or the "thrust diagram" (G); its planar projection (primal grid Γ, or the "form diagram"); and the reciprocal diagram (dual grid Γ\*, or the "force diagram" ).

#### RV2 workflow

The workflow of RV2 is based on the theoretical framework of TNA, which can be broken down into 7 main steps that will be explained in the next pages of this module.

### Diagrams

#### From 2D to 2.5D

Let's start from an example of the previous module. In the image below, we can summarize most of the key concepts you have learned so far: Form and Force diagram, Supports and Loads, Duality and Reciprocity.

#### The Form diagram

Even in the case of TNA, you will start the form-finding process with the Form diagram. In this case, the Form diagram is the horizontal projection of the Thrust Network, which is a discretised version of the shell we want to design, as shown in the upper part of Fig.2. To make a comparison with Fig.1, in the lower part of Fig.2, you can see the AGS example with the horizontal projection of the form diagram. The horizontal projection will be our starting point in RV2.&#x20;

![Fig.2: Top - RV2 example; Bottom - AGS example with the horizontal projection of the form diagram.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (245).png>)

In a 3D structure, the Form diagram is not anymore a polyline, but it is represented by a network of lines with a certain topology or Pattern. Once the pattern has been defined, the boundary conditions as supports and potential openings can be added.&#x20;

#### The Force diagram

So far, everything works more or less the same as for the 2D methods. Once you have defined your Form diagram and all the boundary conditions (supports, openings, etc.), the force diagram can be generated. Compared to 2D cases, since the number of nodes and edges is higher, the Force diagram will look a bit more complicated, but it will always be related to the Form diagram by the duality and reciprocity conditions. Initially, RhinoVAULT2 creates the "centroidal dual" of the Form diagram. This means that the dual graph is defined by placing its vertices at the centroids of their corresponding faces in the Form diagram (Fig.3). Both diagrams have the same number of edges, and the vertices in one diagram correspond to faces in the other, and vice versa. The two diagrams are not yet reciprocal, meaning that the corresponding edges in the diagrams are not perpendicular to each other. Yes, perpendicular! The orientation of the corresponding edges in the form and the force diagrams in RV2 are oriented in a perpendicular orientation to one another (Maxwell representation), compared to the "traditional parallel orientantion (Cremona representation) of graphic statics.&#x20;

![Fig.3: Form diagram (left) and its dual graph (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png>)

Once the dual graph has been created, the horizontal equilibrium algorithm makes the edges in the two diagrams perpendicular between each other. Now the two diagrams are dual and reciprocal, and this means that the dual graph became our Force diagram (Fig.4).

### Equilibrium in 2 steps

In TNA, hence also in RhinoVAULT2, the equilibrium is calculated in two steps: first, the horizontal equilibrium, that creates the Force diagram, and then the vertical equilibrium, which generates the Thrust Network.

#### Horizontal equilibrium

The horizontal equilibrium step corresponds to what you have done so far in the previous modules. In the research of the equilibrium, RhinoVAULT2 offers the possibility to mediate between Form and Force diagrams, meaning that, you, as a designer, can intervene in both diagrams, to achieve faster the reciprocity condition (perpendicular edges).

#### Vertical equilibrium

To conclude the form-finding process and to design a 3D funicular structure in equilibrium, the last step needed is the vertical equilibrium calculation. This step is new compared to the previous modules, and it allows you to generate the Thrust Network, as mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial. The Vertical equilibrium is iteratively computed based on the desired target height value of the structure, which can be defined by the designer.&#x20;

We need to update the Z-coordinates of the nodes in the Form diagram, but we need to be sure that the resultant Thrust Network will be in equilibrium with the vertical loads applied.&#x20;

Once the horizontal equilibrium has been established, the distribution of horizontal forces in the system is fixed. The magnitude of the horizontal forces, instead, depends on a scale factor, which determines the depth of the Thrust network (Fig.5). A higher scale factor results in higher horizontal forces and therefore a shallower three-dimensional shape. Vice versa, a lower scale factor results in lower horizontal forces and thus we obtain a deeper solution. _This is similar to what you have already seen in the previous modules._&#x20;

![Fig.5: Relation between force magnitude and depth of the Thrust Network.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (358).png>)

To conclude, given the desired target height, RhinoVAULT2 iteratively re-scales the Thrust Network in the z-axis. It computes the self-weight of the structure, considering the tributary area of each node until the highest vertex lies at the desired target height (Fig.6).
