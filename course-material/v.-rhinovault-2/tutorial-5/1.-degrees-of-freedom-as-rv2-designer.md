# 1. Degrees of Freedom as RV2 designer

In this page of the tutorial, you will learn all the possibilities to control the form-finding process of a shell structure inside RV2 . These features allow to precisely intervene during the design phase making RV2 a transparent tool, easily manageable by the designer. In the following sections, all the main concepts will be explained.

### 1. Boundaries and Supports

The design process starts tracing the boundaries of your structure in the plan, defining which sides will be supported and which one will be open. After this step, you need to define the pattern of your Form diagram. In RhinoVAULT2, there are many options to generate a pattern.&#x20;

### 2. Pattern

There are many ways to generate a topological pattern. Each method has pros and cons, and the desired design or workflow will help determine which method is more appropriate.

In the case of the rib layout variations for the [rib-stiffened funicular floor system](https://block.arch.ethz.ch/brg/research/rib-stiffened-funicular-floor-system) Fig.2, the boundary remains fixed (the footprint and depth of the floor). However, depending on the topology of the form diagram, the distribution and flow of forces change drastically Fig.3.&#x20;

![Fig.2: 3D-printed floor system.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

![Fig.3: Different patterns for the same floor geometry have significantly different force distributions.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png>)

The Form diagram is the horizontal projection of the Thrust Network, which represents one possible way for the loads to flow down towards the supports. So, the topology of the pattern (Form diagram) will be reflected in the generation of the Force diagram. Since controlling the Force diagram is part of your form-finding process, the decision you make about the pattern is quite important.&#x20;

The images below clarify the influence of the pattern in the form-finding process. In the first image (Fig.4), a quad mesh pattern clearly defines two main directions for the forces. In this case, interact with forces during the form-finding process is easier. Moreover, the reaction forces, the green vectors in the picture, are also aligned along with the two main directions, making easier the design of the boundary conditions around your structure.&#x20;

![Fig.4: Form diagram with a quad mesh pattern (left) and corresponding Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (111).png>)

The next image shows a tri mesh pattern in the same squared boundary (Fig.5). In this case, interact with the Force diagram is not as easy as for the quad pattern, and the variability in direction and magnitude of the reaction forces can make the design of the supports more demanding.

![Fig.5: Form diagram with a tri mesh pattern (left) and corresponding Force diagram (right). ](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (160).png>)

A triangulated pattern instead, could be a good solution in the case of a complex set of boundaries and features (holes, etc.), since, in this case, the definition of only two clear directions for the flow of forces is not possible.

![Fig.6: Form diagram with a tri mesh pattern.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

Another powerful feature, available in RV2, is "create Pattern from Skeleton". This option provides an easy and intuitive method for generating complex patterns for free form vaults with just a few clicks (Fig.7).

![Fig.7: Pattern examples using the "Skeleton" function.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (316).png>)

All the options to generate patterns are described more in detail in the RV2 User Manual: &#x20;

### 3. Add edges

Extra edges can be added inside a pattern to add specific features in the structure. The edges of the Form diagram represent the horizontal projection of the lines where the forces flow. If we add an edge, we are creating a new path for the forces. This means that if you want to shape your structure customising the load path, adding edges is a useful way to do it. In the images below you can see better this process. The starting point is a Form diagram with a quad pattern, supported at the corners (Fig.8a,b).

![Fig.8a: Top view of the Form diagram (left), and of the Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (237).png>)

![Fig.8b: 3D view of Form diagram and Thrust Network (left),  and of the Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (89).png>)

After the calculation of Horizontal and Vertical equilibrium, let's suppose we want to add a diagonal crease and we know that the supports up-right and bottom-left can carry more forces. As you can notice in Fig.9a,b, a diagonal is now in the quad pattern of the Form diagram, and this is also visible in the Force diagram, with new diagonal edges in the centre (Fig.9a). The only adding of the diagonal did not change much the final result (Fig.9b). The crease is not there yet, and from the magnitude of the four resultants is clear that they are still all the same. What is different compared to before is that the diagonal gives us the opportunity to increase the forces along its direction and reach our design goals.&#x20;

![Fig.9a: Top view of the Form diagram (left), and of the Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png>)

![Fig.9b: 3D view of Form diagram and Thrust Network (left),  and of the Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (320).png>)

To attract forces along the new diagonal, we stretched the Force diagram, increasing the length of the edges corresponding to the diagonal we added in the Form diagram (Fig.10a). This means that these edges are now carrying much more forces than before. Through this operation, we created a crease in the Thrust Network and this is clear from the magnitude of the resultants at the corners (Fig.10b).&#x20;

![Fig.10a: Top view of the Form diagram (left), and of the Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

![Fig.10b: 3D view of Form diagram and Thrust Network (left),  and of the Force diagram (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (414).png>)

### 4. Make holes

If you want to make holes in your structure, the best way to do it is to define the position of the holes from the beginning. Among the possibilities that you have to generate a pattern, you should use the command _"from triangulation"_ and select the holes as inner boundaries (see Fig.11). Another way to create holes in your Form diagram is by using the command "Delete Vertices" from the "Modify Pattern" menu. Making holes can be useful in case you have obstacles or objects to overcome.

### 5. Sag function&#x20;

In section **a. Boundaries and Supports**, you might have noticed that the boundaries of the Form diagram have an inward curvature compared to the straight outline of the space we want to cover with our structure. RV2 has a feature called _"Sag"_ that makes a sag automatically in correspondence of the openings. To understand the reason for this feature, we can isolate one vertex of the form diagram and graphically calculate the equilibrium of that node drawing the force diagram (Fig.12). In the case on the left (straight boundaries), since the directions of the forces along the opening needs to be horizontal, you can not close the force polygon, unless the force perpendicular to the opening is zero. In the case on the right, with a sag equal to 10% of the span of the opening, the force polygon can be closed using forces with finite magnitude.&#x20;

![Fig.12: Pattern with no sag (left); pattern with 10% sag at the openings (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (311).png>)

In conclusion, a minimum sag is needed to find the horizontal equilibrium, unless there are no forces in the direction perpendicular to the openings. As you can see from the left image below (Fig.13), if you run the horizontal equilibrium in the case with straight boundaries, RV2 will try to reduce as much as possible the forces perpendicular to the openings. As a result, you will get a structure with forces flowing mainly only in one direction (parallel to the openings). Instead, in the case on the right (with sag), you will get a more equilibrated force distribution, with forces flowing in the two main directions.&#x20;

![Fig.13: Form and Force diagrams with straight boundaries (left) and with the sag (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (266).png>)

Finally, loooking at Fig.14, is clear how the structural behaviour changes and is influenced by this feature.

![Fig.14: Flow of forces in the case with straight boundaries (left) and boundaries with the sag (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (261).png>)

### 6. Supports with vertical resultant

In some cases, in the design of a structure, we can encounter into constraints coming from the boundary conditions. For example, could be that we want to add supports in the middle of the structure, but the new supporting area can only take vertical loads. In RhinoVAULT2, after we reach the horizontal and vertical equilibrium, we can still move the vertices of the Thrust Network along the Z direction. The supports we picked at the beginning, at the boundaries, carry loads in any direction, and if we move them along Z, this will not change. Instead, the vertices in the middle of the shell can be used as support and moved along Z getting only a vertical reaction. As you can realise, the vertices in the middle of the Thrust Network are in horizontal equilibrium and if we move them only along Z, this will still be the case (Fig.15).

![Fig.15: Addition of internal vertical supports.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png>)

### 7. Mediation among Form and Forces

In the research of the equilibrium, RhinoVAULT2 offers the possibility to mediate between Form and Force diagrams, meaning that, you, as a designer, can intervene in both diagrams, to achieve the reciprocity condition (perpendicular edges). When you run the horizontal equilibrium, RV2 will ask you if you want to modify only the force diagram (alpha equal to form 100) keeping the form diagram as it is, or the opposite (alpha equal to form 0), or all the options in between the two extreme cases.&#x20;

This process is done iteratively, and in RV2, a default number of iterations is fixed. In some cases, after the default number of iterations (100) the reciprocity condition is not satisfied yet, and on both diagrams, the values of the deviation angles will appear. The deviation angles represent the deviation between the 90˚ reciprocity condition and the actual state of the diagrams after 100 iterations. For example, if an edge has a deviation angle of 30˚ (text tags on the edges in the diagrams), it means that it needs a further rotation of 30˚ to achieve 90˚. In Fig.16, you can see an example of horizontal equilibrium not found after 100 iterations, and the text tags in both diagrams representing the deviation angles.&#x20;

![Fig.16: Deviation angles in the Form and Force diagrams. Horizontal equilibrium not reached yet.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)

### 8. Force distribution

RhinoVAULT2 offers the possibility to make the force distribution inside the structure homogeneous. The advantage of a uniform distribution is related to the materialisation process. Structural elements with big axial forces require bigger cross-sections than elements with small forces. If the force distribution in the structural elements is not uniform, we need different cross-sections to build our structure. If the force distribution is homogeneous, only one cross-section for the entire structure may be needed. To do so, we can modify the edge attributes of the Force diagram and apply a smaller range to their max and min length (Fig.17).

![Fig.17: Example of forces not homogeneous (left), force diagram after redistribution (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (302).png>)

### 9. Height of the structure

Another variable available for the designer is the height of the structure. In the vertical equilibrium step, RV2 will determine the scale factor of the magnitude of the horizontal forces, based on your desired height. The default value for the target height is 25% of the length of the diagonal of the bounding box of the Form Diagram, but you can input a new target height (Fig.18).

![Fig.18: Vertical equilibrium using three different target height.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (385).png>)

### 10. Loads

The TNA method allows the application of parallel loads to the structure, and RhinoVAULT2 does the same. By default, the load considered is related to the self-weight of the structure, but additional point loads can be added at the nodes of the network (Fig.19).

![Fig.19: Application of two point loads (left and center) and new shape of the shell (right).](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (387).png>)

### 11. Stretching forces &#x20;

Another way to directly modify the shape of our structure is to play with the Force diagram. The scaling and stretching of its edges change the magnitude of the horizontal forces and this will affect the shape of the shell. In Fig.20 you can see the correspondence between the creases in the shell and the stretched or not stretched edges of the Force diagram.&#x20;
