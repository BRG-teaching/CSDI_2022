# Exercise 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
Complete the tasks below, and submit **by 9:00am on Friday, November 18th one zipped folder** that includes:

1. the Rhinoceros file.
2. the Grasshopper definition file (one algorithm per task but all in one single Grasshopper file!).
3. The PDF document of the questionnaire.

Please follow the file naming convention as shown in the [**Syllabus**](../../syllabus.md#submissions).

### **Submit here**
{% endhint %}

## Tasks

Complete the following five tasks.

### 1. External loads

Add multiple external loads to the current algorithm.

### 2. Rise

Just like you did in the exercise from module II, modify the rise of the funicular using the force diagram.

### 3. Horizontal thrust

Constrain the design space to those funiculars in compression whose horizontal thrust is no larger than 15 kN. &#x20;

### 4. Asymmetric load

Display a changing asymmetric load as if a truck would be crossing the bridge. Use a number slider in Grasshopper to change the anchor point of the asymmetric load.&#x20;

### 5. Compact program



### 6. Program a new design

Using the tutorial algorithm as a base, reproduce the algorithm of the structure below.&#x20;
