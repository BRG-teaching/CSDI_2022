# Exercise 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
Complete the tasks below, and submit **by 9:00am on Friday, November 18th one zipped folder** that includes:

1. the Rhinoceros file.
2. the Grasshopper definition file (one algorithm per task but all in one single Grasshopper file!).
3. The PDF document of the questionnaire.

Please follow the file naming convention as shown in the [**Syllabus**](../../syllabus.md#submissions).

### **Submit here**
{% endhint %}

## Tasks

Complete the following five tasks.

### 1. External loads

Add multiple external loads to the current algorithm.

### 2. Horizontal thrust

Constrain the design space to those funiculars in compression whose horizontal thrust is smaller or equal to 15 kN. &#x20;

### 3. Asymmetric load

Display an asymmetric load as if a group of people would be crossing the bridge.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Hint: use a number slider in Grasshopper to change the anchor point of the asymmetric load.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 4. Compact program

The algorithm from the tutorial is built up in sections. Put it now all together in a single Python component.

### 5. Program a new design

Using the tutorial algorithm as a base, reproduce the algorithm of the structure below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Hint: use twice the compact Python from the tutorial (or the solution of Task 5), one for each of the two funiculars supporting the bridge.
