## Task 1: loop

Create an algorithm using a for loop that generates the following list: \[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70].&#x20;

## Task 2: loop and conditional

Given the following list L1=\[\[5,3],\[0,3],\[0,7],\[6,-6],\[10,-3],\[11,8],\[6,0],\[1,1]], create a new list (L2) **only** with the lists from L1 **if** the two items add up to 7 or more than 7. For example: item "\[5,3]", 5+3 >= 7, so this list is good!

## Task 3: geometry

Create an algorithm that draws a spiral in 2D. To do this create a for loop that adds a point, rotates it around \[0,0,0] and stores it in a list. After, outside the for loop, use rs.AddPolyline to create a polyline connecting the spiral dots.&#x20;
