# Tools

In this course we will be using the following tools:

For modules I, II and III, we will be using Rhino 7 and Grasshopper. Grasshopper comes already pre-installed within Rhino 7.

For modules IV and V, we will be using Rhino 7 with two add-on packages of the [**COMPAS**](https://compas.dev/) **** framework: Interactive Graphic Statics (IGS) and RhinoVAULT 2 (rV2). The installation instructions for these packages will be provided later in the course, before the start of module IV.
