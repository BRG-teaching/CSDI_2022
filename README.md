### Welcome to the course Computational Structural Design I: Computational Graphic Statics!

This course presents new structural design opportunities that emerge when graphic statics, an intuitive equilibrium-based method for the form-finding, analysis and design of structures, is combined with computational tools. After a review of graphic statics fundamentals and an introduction to basic parametric tools, the course focuses on studying different computational approaches to program graphic statics algorithms for the form-finding and analysis of structures, from linear (procedural) algorithms to programs with more complex data structures. More specifically, the students will build linear parametric graphic statics models using Grasshopper, read and code basic graphic statics algorithms using Python, and explore the design space offered by tools developed by the Block Research Group such as Interactive Graphic Statics (IGS) and RhinoVault2 (rV2). The practical potential and relevance of these methods will be demonstrated through various design-oriented tutorials and exercises.
